# 7dtd-chrani-bot
A seven days to die Server-Bot to manage players and game-events

this bot is aimed towards providing simple, hassle-free communities

we don't try to be the most feature-complete bot, nor do we try to be better than the others or
anything really. we just feel that our needs seem to be different than the needs of most other
servers, and all currently existing managers are simply 'too much' for us, without providing us
with some of the functions we desperately need

we try to be easy to set up and use.
basic lobby and base-building, controlling the influx of new players, auto-kicking and banning
the bad apples. Cleaning up inactive players.w

Most of this should happen automagically. that's about it really. the system is quite easy to extend, so feel
free to develop more elaborate features. this bot will stay simple though
